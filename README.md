## Technologies Used

## Questions

- How do I get the side menu to stick below the hamburger menu?
- How do I get the footer on bigger screens to grow to the remaining height of the page? Right now it creates a white space below it. :\
- Is it better to set the font-sizes in EM and change the body font-size (like I did), or use REM and change the font-size to each element according to screen sizes?
